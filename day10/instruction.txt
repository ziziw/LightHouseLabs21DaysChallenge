## Challenge #10
Environment Canada has called and wants a report sent to them of all the rocks in your grid, for use in their latest map.

Write a function called allRocks() which when called will return an array of the coordinates of all the rocks in your grid. (Example: allRocks() should return ["D1", "E3", "F3", "E4", "F4", "B8", "H8", "B9", "B10"])
