## Challenge #14
Ship captains are really starting to rely on you to plot their routes through your area. Your name is being sung in pubs and taverns up and down the coast. And this time, it's for the right reasons! The ship captains are starting to be curious about some of the cells in your grid, and what they want is to know if a cell is dangerous. They know if ones are safe, but sometimes, they are willing to accept a bit of danger so that they can get a faster delivery time.

A cell is considered dangerous if there is a rock or a strong current in it, OR in the cells immediately above, below, left, or right of it. Write a function called isDangerous() that will take a cell in the format 'G7' and return a true or a false value. (Example: isDangerous('E4') would return true, because there is a rock there. Similarly, isDangerous('B9') would return true, because there are rocks and currents AROUND the cell. However, isDangerous('I6') would return false because it is open water.)
