## Challenge #3
Okay, let's get our lighthouse actually doing some work! As the lighthouse keeper, sometimes you'll need to shine the light directly on a particular cell in the grid, to alert passing ships to a danger there.

Your job is to write a function called lightCell() that takes in the coordinates in the form of 'A3' or 'J9' and returns the contents of that specific cell. (Ex: lightCell('B4'); would return "")

Don’t erase your past code when you work on the new challenge! Remember that the challenges are cumulative so you shouldn’t erase any of your work once you finish a challenge. You will need functions created on prior days to complete future challenges!
