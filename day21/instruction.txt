## Challenge #21
This is it, the last challenge! Is that inspirational music in the background?

You have worked hard to get to this point and now you are about to be rewarded. First, there’s the satisfaction of coding for 21 days in a row (yay!). But, once you finish the 21-Day Coding Challenge you will be entered to win one of many great prizes including: a Macbook Pro, a Sphero, and a Rasberry Pi.

Given that you can do all sorts of fancy analysis on your grid, we're going to give you the final challenge for your Lighthouse9000™ system. Ship captains are going to send you a series of cells that they want to travel through, not just their start and end cells. You need to let them know if they should use that route or not.

Write a function evaluateRoute() which will take an array of cells in the form: ["A1", "B2", "C3", "D4"] (there could be any number of cells), and return a boolean true or false according to the following rules:

If any cells have rocks, it should return false.
If more than two cells have strong currents, it should return false.
Otherwise, it should return true.
