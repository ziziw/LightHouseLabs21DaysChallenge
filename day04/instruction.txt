## Challenge #4
In the area where the lighthouse is watching, the grid, there are many rocks which ships would need to avoid. Rocks are indicated with the ^ symbol on the grid.

Write a function called isRock() which will take in a coordinate in the form of 'C7' and return a true or a false boolean value depending on whether there is a rock in that cell or not. (Example: isRock('D1'); would return true)

Don’t erase your past code when you work on the new challenge! Remember that the challenges are cumulative so you shouldn’t erase any of your work once you finish a challenge. You will need functions created on prior days to complete future challenges!
